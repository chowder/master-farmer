# Master Farmer 

A Telegram bot to help you keep track of your farming cycles, and notify you when your crops are ready for harvest. 

Unlike a simple timer, it uses [growth ticks](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Farming#Growth_timing) and your player-specific growth tick offset, to precisely determine the next harvest time. 

The official instance is hosted at [@MasterFarmerBot](https://t.me/MasterFarmerBot)
